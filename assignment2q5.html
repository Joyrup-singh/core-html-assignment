    <h1>Full Stack Web Developement</h1>
    <p>Description List Of Full Stack Web Developement Tech Stack</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>1.LAMP</dt>
        <dd><p>LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:

            <li>Linux (operating system)</li>
            <li>Apache (HTTP server)</li>
            <li>MySQL (relational database management)</li>
            <li>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li>
        </p></dd>
        <dt>2.ASP.NET</dt>
        <dd><p>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world.
            <li>ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework</li>
            <li>IIS – Microsoft’s web server</li>
            <li>Angular frontend framework with TypeScript</li>
            <li>SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database</li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers</li>
        </p></dd>
        <dt>3.MEAN</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers. Among these benefits are the use of a single language (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free. MEAN consists of:
            <li>MongoDB (NoSQL database)</li>
            <li>Express.js backend web framework</li> 
            <li>Angular.js frontend framework</li> 
            <li>Node.js server-side JavaScript</li>         
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>4.MERN</dt>
        <dd><p>Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.

            The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
            
            Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.
        </p></dd>
        <dt>5.MEVN</dt>
        <dd><P>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.

            Vue.js is easy to learn, delivers a clear programming style, and provides superb performance for web applications.
        </P></dd>
        <dt>6.Ruby on Rails</dt>
        <dd><p>Ruby on Rails is a programming environment that uses Ruby, a dynamic programming language. With RoR, you can simplify the entire development process.

            A server-side web app development written in the Ruby programming language requires less knowledge to work on. It allows the use of default structures for database management and web pages.
            
            Ruby on Rails works well with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating UIs and JSON or XML for transferring data.
            
            NOTE: While Ruby on Rails was extremely popular in the late 2010s, it has experienced a sharp decline in usage over the past three years. Fewer developers are choosing to specialize in this framework, which means finding Ruby on Rails developers has become increasingly difficult and expensive.
        </p></dd>
        <dt>7.Python</dt>
        <dd><p>
            One of the fastest-growing languages is Python. It is easy to use and commonly taught to college students as a beginner development language. It has many modern and powerful features. Python has also become very popular because of its heavy usage for machine learning and data science. It can also be used for building web applications by using the popular Django web framework.
        </p></dd>
        <dt>8.JAVA</dt>
        <dd><p>
            Java is not as popular as it once was. It is popular for enterprise applications, but new projects tend to gravitate to newer and lighter-weight application stacks like Node.js and Python. Java is still heavily used and there are lots of Java developers all over the world.
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Spring</li>
            <li>Wildfly</li>
            <li>Linux</li>
            <li>NGINX</li>
